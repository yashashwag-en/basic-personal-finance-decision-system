# SmartBudgetAI

SmartBudgetAI is a financial analysis dashboard that evaluates income, expenses, savings efficiency, and overall financial stability using structured rule-based logic.

About This Project

I built this project to go beyond a simple budget calculator. Most tools just show how much money is left after expenses. I wanted to create something that actually analyzes financial health and gives logical insights based on real financial principles.

This system performs structured cashflow analysis and provides a stability score based on how efficiently income is allocated. Instead of random advice, all recommendations are derived from ratio-based modeling and financial logic.

What It Analyzes

The system takes the following inputs:

Monthly income

Fixed expenses

Variable expenses

Savings goal

Expected annual investment return

Based on these inputs, it calculates:

Net monthly cashflow

Financial Stability Index (0–100)

Risk level classification

Fixed, variable, and savings ratios

Emergency fund requirement (6 months of expenses)

Emergency runway (months you can survive without income)

Time required to achieve savings goal (with compounding)

Optimization impact by reducing discretionary spending

All results are computed using mathematical modeling and financial ratios.
